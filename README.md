➡️AtliQ Mart is a growing manufacturer in Gujarat and they have been operating in Ahmedabad, Surat, and Vadodara & are planning to scale up in tier 1 cities in upcoming 2 years.

➡️They are facing some issues as few key customers did not extend their annual contract and the major reason was service issues. In short, bad customer service.

➡️So, they want to fix the issue before expanding and want the analytics team to provide a business intelligence solution to get rid of these issues. And it would help them track the key metrics on a regular basis for all the key customers across the cities. Also this would help them take the further business decisions based on the insights provided by the BI/Analytics team.
 
 🔍Key metrics to track:

✨ OT % - ON TIME DELIVERY %
✨ IF % - IN FULL DELIVERY %
✨ OTIF% - ON TIME IN FULL DELIVERY %
✨ LiFR - LINE FILL RATE
✨ VoFR – VOLUME FILL RATE
